 Baby sitter App

The application I’ll build will be a tool in order to contact  babysitters  to check on your baby, incase of emergencies or simply if you’ve got a date, apointment, etc.

Problem Definition

As a seven children parent, I know its hard to find someone you truly trust to check on your little babies for a period of time. Therefore due to all this awarness I want to build a simple app, which will show you our trusted members, fastly get in touch and leave your house with a smile on your face.
